This is the first readme file. It might change as I go forward with the project.

The idea of this project is to emulate a data lake kind of an architecture. I am planning on using HDFS filesystem to store all the raw data coming from different sources. One idea I have in my head is to take in Twitter data, store it on HDFS, and build some insights from it. 

For now, I am thinking of using AWS for the HDFS part, twitter API to get some real data, and maybe use Tableau/Orange/somethingElse to build some visualizations from it. 

Let's see how this project takes shape. It might change as I work on it. I don't want to be spending too much on AWS for sure :)
