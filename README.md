# Project title
The idea of this project is to emulate a data lake kind of an architecture. 
We'll be using Twitter APIs to pull in some data, store it in HIVE tables, and use Tableau on top of it to draw some insights.

## Getting started

1. AWS - aws.amazon.com
2. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) - https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html
3. Hive - https://hive.apache.org/
4. Tableau - https://tableau.com

An AWS accont is needed to spin up a Hadoop cluster. We'll be using this to store all our tweets on HDFS. We'll also be using Hive tables to build our database. Finally, we'll connect Tableau and our Hive database to draw some visualizations.
